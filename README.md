# A-Robust-Hybrid-Classical-and-Quantum-Model-for-Short-Term-Wind-Speed-Forecasting

Here’s the rewritten version starting with "About," as you asked:


This project entails the development of a robust hybrid classical–quantum model for short-term wind speed forecasting, aimed at addressing the increasing challenges faced by power utilities. The growing reliance on renewable energy sources, particularly wind power, introduces significant uncertainty and stochastic behavior into power scheduling, making accurate and reliable forecasting methods essential.

The proposed solution combines the strengths of two powerful approaches: a "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)" network, capable of capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), also known as a parameterized quantum circuit. By applying quantum gates based on the principles of quantum mechanics, QNNs offer enhanced expressive power, potentially achieving a quantum advantage over classical models in learning complex patterns.

To ensure that the model maintains high performance across seasonal variations and diverse data conditions,This approach uses orthogonal experimental designs to systematically determine the most stable and effective parameter settings.

Historical wind speed data from seven sites across Taiwan, the Philippines, China, and South Korea are used to train and evaluate the model, with the goal of forecasting 24-hour-ahead wind speeds at the "Fuhai wind farm" in Taiwan. This forecasting is crucial for improving the reliability and integration of renewable energy into the power grid.

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust hybrid model significantly outperforms several leading state-of-the-art models, including the "Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network (NAR)", "Random Forest", "Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)", "Support Vector Regression (SVR)", and the classical "LSTM" model. These outcomes underscore the potential of combining quantum computing with traditional machine learning to address real-world forecasting challenges in the energy sector.

Overall, this project offers an innovative, effective solution for short-term wind speed forecasting, ultimately contributing to the enhanced stability and efficiency of modern power systems.
